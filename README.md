Comicbot
==========

Searches http://www.comiclist.com/ for books in your pull list.

Can also search ComicList's predictions for future weeks.

Thanks to Leonard Richardson for BeautifulSoup!

To do:
-------
* Fill out README
* Make help function?
* TESTS
* Scan previous weeks (I occasionally look through previous lists to find patterns about when titles come out...)
* Turn it into a web app?
