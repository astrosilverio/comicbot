Comicbot
==========

Searches http://www.comiclist.com/ for books in your pull list.

Can also search ComicList's predictions for future weeks.

To do:
-------
* Fill out README
* Make a UI
* Scan previous weeks (I occasionally look through previous lists to find patterns about when titles come out...)
* Turn it into a web app?
